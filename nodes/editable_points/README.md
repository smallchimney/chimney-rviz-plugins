#### Editable Points
It is used to generate an interactive marker which can move each point independently.
Note that, original RViz's interactive marker do not support move single control in
the interactive marker, so it just hide the others when move any control. Remember to
refresh the interactive marker when mouse-up to keep the others points stay in place.
